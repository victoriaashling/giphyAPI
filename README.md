# Giphy API

This site comes with a number of buttons already created -- click one and it will call ten gifs of that actor or actress from the Giphy API, as well as the gif's rating. You can add a new person by typing their name in the field and clicking the "Add Actor" button.

You can find this site live [here](https://victoriaashling.github.io/giphyAPI).
